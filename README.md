# ACLU Child Separation Project
### About: 

For this project, I implemented data analysis using R. I used the libraries readr and dplyr which helped me to build the project. I analyze the data of ACLU to gain a better undstanding and insight of the situation at the border regarding the family separtation policy enacted in 2018.
 
### Note:

I used the .csv file provided by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) which provided the data related to the immigrant children separated from their families at the border of Mexico.

ACLU has noted concerns about hte comprehensiveness and accuracy of the government's data. Despite this, working with the data available can still yield valuable insights.
